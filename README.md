# Idea
I felt that my desk needed something to make it more productive, something like a macropad!

# Backgroud
I've never used Fusion 360 before, only TinkerCAD for some other projects that I tackled, and definitely never KiCAD or any sort of firmware app. I've always been super into engineering, but normally the mechanical part of it, never really the electronics side even though I've always wanted to try it. Turns out, this was the perfect oppurtunity!
